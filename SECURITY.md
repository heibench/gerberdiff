## Scope

gerberdiff is a local CLI tool that reads Gerber/Excellon files from disk.  
It does not start network servers, accept remote input, or persist credentials.  
The most relevant attack surface is **malicious Gerber files** that could cause
path traversal, resource exhaustion, or arbitrary code execution through crafted macros.
