## [Unreleased]

## [0.30.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING -- the exit-code contract now matches partspec and netspec**
  ([A3]). `0` no differences, `1` differences (with `--fail-on-diff`), `2` the
  comparison could not be completed, `4` an input could not be read or parsed,
  `64` usage (`EX_USAGE`). Previously `2` meant a parse error and `1` doubled as
  both "differences found" and "could not write the output file". A gate written
  `[ $? -eq 0 ]` is unaffected; one that treated `2` as a parse failure must now
  read `4`.
- **Geometry report schema `version` 2 -> 3**, adding `summary.outcome`,
  `summary.unrepresented` and a per-layer `unrepresented`. Additive: every v2
  field keeps its meaning.

### Added

- **`geomdiff` has a third outcome, and says what it could not model** ([A3]) --
  `identical` | `different` | `indeterminate`. A stroke drawn with a macro or
  block aperture is not modelled by the geometry engine, and used to vanish: a
  board with an added trace reported `0 changes` at exit `0`, with JSON
  byte-identical to comparing a board against a copy of itself, while the raster
  engine reported the change. The two engines answered the same question
  differently and the geometry one gave the dangerous answer. Such operations are
  now counted in `summary.unrepresented`, named on stderr, and make the outcome
  `indeterminate` at exit `2` -- which does not wait for `--fail-on-diff`, since
  that flag chooses whether a *difference* fails, not whether the tool could look.
  `different` outranks `indeterminate`, so one unmodellable stroke cannot mask a
  trace that moved.

### Fixed

- **Draw operations using an undefined aperture are no longer dropped in
  silence** ([#17]) -- selecting a D-code that was never defined (or drawing
  before any `Dnn` selection at all) left the flash or stroke carrying an
  aperture index with no definition behind it.  Every consumer treated that
  as nothing to draw: both geometry emit helpers returned early and the
  raster renderer drew nothing, with no diagnostic at any severity.  `diff`
  and `geomdiff` then reported `0 changes` at exit `0`, and the JSON report
  was byte-identical to a comparison of two genuinely identical boards -- so
  a real fabrication change could pass a `--fail-on-diff` gate invisibly.
  The parser now emits an `Error` diagnostic at the offending draw
  operation, which the existing promotion path turns into exit `2` for
  `parse`, `render`, `diff` and `geomdiff` alike.  D02 moves and G36/G37
  region contours consume no aperture and are unaffected.

- **Degenerate region contours no longer leak line geometry** -- a G36/G37
  contour whose points are collinear produced a zero-area `MultiLineString`
  from `make_valid` that flowed into the geometry engine; region expansion
  now keeps only polygonal parts.

### Changed

- Local coverage floor aligned with the CI gate (`fail_under` 85 -> 90;
  actual coverage is ~94%).
- Stale documentation corrected: the overlay-PNG colour table no longer
  lists the removed "yellow" class; `SECURITY.md` supported versions
  updated from 0.14.x to 0.29.x; `CONTRIBUTING.md` blesses
  conventional-commit prefixes (matching recent history).
- Package `__init__` modules for `parse`, `render`, `diff`, and `export`
  gained one-line docstrings.

### Added

- **Documentation site** at <https://heibench.github.io/gerberdiff/>
  -- MkDocs + Material with mkdocstrings API reference, MathJax for the
  LaTeX notation already used in the docs, and Changelog/Contributing
  included via snippets. Built strictly and deployed to GitHub Pages by
  `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on every push to `main` that touches docs
  or the package.

- Edge-case test suite for the geometry engine's guard paths: block
  nesting depth limit, invalid layer indices, zero-dimension apertures,
  degenerate regions and strokes, macro flash dispatch, the
  equal-geometry attribution guard, and driver diagnostic forwarding.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Package metadata reflects both engines** -- the PyPI `description`
  and the CLI group help text described only the raster engine; both now
  cover the raster overlay and geometry diff pipelines. Added `geometry`
  and `shapely` to the package keywords. No behaviour changes.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Geometry diff engine** (`gerberdiff/geometry/`) -- a second,
  Cairo-free diff pipeline operating on the parsed vector geometry via
  `shapely`. Resolution-independent and attributed: each change is
  classified as `added`, `removed`, `moved` (with dx/dy displacement,
  down to micrometres), or `resized`, with net names from `%TO.N%`
  attributes propagated onto changes. The raster engine is unchanged;
  the two are complementary (hybrid architecture). See
  `docs/geometry-diff.md`.

  - Aperture expansion: exact primitives with adaptive tessellation
    (<= 1 um chord tolerance); exact Minkowski sums for non-round
    linear strokes (convex hull of the aperture at both endpoints);
    all 7 macro primitive types with spec-compliant exposure scoping;
    region fills with even-odd contour semantics; aperture holes
    subtracted from the flash only (spec semantics).
  - Polarity as ordered boolean replay (dark unions, clear subtracts),
    including block apertures flattened into the outer replay with
    renderer-verified global-erase semantics for block-internal clears.
  - Exact-cancellation matching: ops carry source-based content
    signatures (aperture *content*, not D-code numbering), so unchanged
    ops cancel exactly and -- via lazy expansion -- never construct
    geometry at all.
  - Boolean added/removed material per layer with snap-rounded
    differences and a dust filter; full ordered-replay fallback when
    clear polarity is present.
  - Attribution: KD-tree gated matching with tunable tolerances
    (`move_tol`, `gate_radius`, `area_tol`); orientation-normalised
    dimension comparison so a 90-degree-rotated footprint classifies
    as `moved`, not `resized`.

- **`gerberdiff geomdiff` CLI subcommand** with `--move-tol`,
  `--gate-radius`, `--area-tol`, `--dust-area` (mm units), `--out-json`,
  `--out-svg`, `--layer`, `--fail-on-diff`, `-q`/`-v`.

- **JSON report schema version 2** (`"mode": "geometry"`): per-layer
  change counts, added/removed areas (mm^2), per-change records with
  centroid/area/displacement/net, and the tolerances used. Documented
  in `docs/schema.md`.

- **SVG overlay export** (`export/svg_export.py`, Cairo-free): removed
  red, added green, moved blue with displacement lines, resized orange;
  even-odd fill preserves aperture holes.

- **Public API**: `compute_geometry_diff`, `GeometryChange`,
  `LayerGeometryDiff`, `GeometryDiffResult` exported from the top-level
  package.

- **Dependency**: `shapely >= 2.0` (binary wheels with bundled GEOS; no
  system library required). Dev dependency `types-shapely` for mypy.

- 127 new tests, including a differential test pinning resolved
  geometry to the Cairo renderer's occupancy (>= 99% pixel agreement)
  and fixture-board integration tests against an independently computed
  flash-matching oracle.

### Changed

- **Cairo is now imported lazily.** `import gerberdiff` no longer
  requires the native cairo library; the parse and geometry pipelines
  (including `gerberdiff geomdiff` and `gerberdiff parse`) work on
  systems without it. Accessing the rasteriser (`render_to_numpy`,
  `render_to_surface`, `compute_diff`, or the `render`/`diff` CLI
  commands) raises the underlying `OSError` only when actually used.
  Raster-engine tests skip cleanly when cairo is unavailable, which
  fixes the previously failing Windows CI job.

- **Project renamed from `gerberdelta` to `gerberdiff`** (2026-04-25,
  unreleased at the time). 0.29.0 is the first published release under
  the new name; no release was ever made as `gerberdelta`. The rename
  window also included: docs reorganised to lowercase-kebab filenames
  with split CLI/API references, an ASCII-only character policy sweep,
  LaTeX math notation for equations in docs, and strict mypy
  annotations across the test suite.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Render/diff regression coverage** -- 411 lines of new tests across
  the renderer, draw-ops, diff engine, and parser: incremental (G91)
  coordinates, step-and-repeat tiling, layer transforms (LM/LR/LS),
  clear-polarity compositing, region merge cascade, polygon aperture
  rotation, macro `unit_scale`, `alignment_offset`, and pixel-level
  render verification. No production code changes.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **`CompiledRender` cached per `BlockAperture`** -- repeated flashes of
  the same block aperture no longer recompile its draw-op groups on
  every flash. The cache is keyed by `id(block_ap)` and evicted by a
  `weakref` finalizer when the aperture is garbage-collected, so stale
  ids cannot produce false hits.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Rect/obround stroke width** -- D01 strokes with rectangle or obround
  apertures are drawn with line width `max(width, height)` instead of
  `min(width, height)`, so traces whose long axis aligns with the stroke
  direction (the common case) are no longer under-stroked; documented as
  an approximation pending geometry-aware rendering.
- **Macro evaluation failures no longer abort the render** -- a macro
  aperture whose primitive evaluation raises is skipped with a
  `UserWarning` instead of crashing the whole render pass.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Parser correctness sweep** --
  - arc bounding boxes account for axis-extrema crossings (0/90/180/270
    degrees), not just the endpoints;
  - step-and-repeat tiles expand the image bounding box and respect
    layer polarity;
  - block aperture (`%AB%`) parsing isolates state correctly (nested
    apertures/layers no longer leak into the parent image);
  - `_apply_format` no longer truncates coordinates with more integer
    digits than the format statement declares;
  - referencing an unknown macro in an aperture definition is an
    `Error`-severity diagnostic (was silently tolerated).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **`DiffResult.has_changes` is a computed property** -- derived from the
  layer results instead of stored at construction, so it cannot drift
  from the data.
- **Excellon parser refactored** -- the nonlocal-closure state pattern is
  replaced with explicit local parser state; behaviour unchanged.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`compute_full_diff`** -- directory-vs-directory diff as a single
  public API call (parse, match, diff, assemble `DiffResult`), with
  `overlay_callback` and `on_diagnostic` hooks.
- **All IR and result types exported** from the top-level package with
  an `__all__` list; README gains API examples.

### Changed

- `diff_cmd` rewritten on top of `compute_full_diff` (the CLI no longer
  duplicates the orchestration logic).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`docs/schema.md`** -- canonical JSON report schema documentation.
- **CI hardening** -- coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=90`), a Windows
  test job in the matrix, and a non-ASCII character check.

### Changed

- **`EXCELLON_SUFFIXES` is public** -- renamed from `_EXCELLON_SUFFIXES`
  in `diff/layer_matcher.py`; it is part of the de-facto API used by the
  CLI and downstream callers.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **`RegionFill` IR redesign** -- G36/G37 region fill boundaries are no
  longer stored as sentinel `DrawOp` objects with
  `InterpolationMode.RegionStart` / `RegionEnd`. A new `RegionFill`
  dataclass (`layer_index`, `net_state_index`, `segments: list[DrawOp]`)
  is emitted by the parser as a single item. `ParsedImage.draw_ops` and
  `BlockAperture.draw_ops` are now typed `list[DrawOp | RegionFill]`.
  `InterpolationMode.RegionStart` and `InterpolationMode.RegionEnd` are
  removed. `compiled_render.py` handles `RegionFill` directly without a
  state-machine sentinel scan. `RegionFill` is exported from the public
  API. Unclosed G36 at M02 now correctly emits a `Warning` diagnostic.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **`_EXCELLON_SUFFIXES` consolidated** -- the duplicate definition in
  `cli.py` is removed; `cli.py` now imports `_EXCELLON_SUFFIXES` from
  `diff/layer_matcher.py`, which remains the single source of truth.

- **`_flush_macro` exception severity upgraded to `Error`** -- a failed
  `parse_macro_body` call (e.g. non-integer variable index `$notanint=...`)
  was silently recorded as a `Warning` with `# pragma: no cover`. It is now
  recorded as `DiagnosticSeverity.Error`, the `# pragma: no cover` tag is
  removed, and a test exercises this path.

- **Fixture paths in tests use `__file__`-relative construction** -- all
  ten `Path("tests/fixtures/...")` occurrences across seven test files are
  replaced with `Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures" / "..."`. Tests now pass
  regardless of the working directory from which pytest is invoked.

- **`--align-offset` Y direction corrected** -- positive `DY` now shifts
  image B downward (positive screen Y), consistent with `DX` shifting
  rightward. Previously positive `DY` moved the geometry upward, which was
  the inverse of the expected screen convention. Help text updated to
  document the convention explicitly.

- **`CoordState` deprecated fields removed** -- `mirror_state`, `axis_select`,
  `offset_a`, `offset_b`, `scale_a`, and `scale_b` were never populated by
  the parser (the corresponding `%MI%`, `%AS%`, `%OF%`, `%SF%` commands were
  handled with `pass`). `CoordState` now carries only `unit: UnitType`.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Public Python API** (`gerberdiff/__init__.py`) -- `parse_gerber`,
  `parse_excellon`, `render_to_surface`, `render_to_numpy`, and `compute_diff`
  are now exported from the top-level package with an `__all__` list. Added a
  `## Python API` section to `README.md` with example usage.

### Changed

- **`SingleLayerDiff` no longer stores raw pixel arrays** -- `arr_a`, `arr_b`,
  and `xor` (three `~48 MB` numpy arrays at 2048^2) have been removed from the
  dataclass. Callers that need a PNG overlay pass an `overlay_callback:
Callable[[ndarray, ndarray, ndarray], None]` to `compute_diff()`; the callback
  is invoked before the arrays are released. The diff CLI uses this callback to
  write the overlay PNG without ever holding all three arrays simultaneously.

- **`_parse` closure in `diff_cmd` returns `ParsedImage`** -- the return type
  annotation was `object` with `# type: ignore[assignment]`; it is now correctly
  typed as `ParsedImage`, and the ignore comment is removed.

- **`_GerberParser._block_stack` uses `_BlockFrame` dataclass** -- replaces the
  unnamed 7-tuple `(d_code, block_ap, saved_nets, saved_layers, saved_apertures,
saved_bbox, saved_layer_idx)` with a named `_BlockFrame` dataclass so that
  field access is explicit and mypy-checked.

### Fixed

- **Dead `changed`/yellow pixel path removed from `png_export.py`** -- both
  images are rendered with the same colour scheme so the `changed` mask (pixels
  present in both A and B with different colour values) is structurally always
  empty. The unreachable `out[changed] = [0, 255, 255, 255]` line and the
  `changed` variable have been removed.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **`LayerType` moved to `types.py`** -- `LayerType` was defined in
  `diff/layer_matcher.py` but is a domain type used across the IR, diff, export,
  and CLI layers. Moving it to `types.py` removes the asymmetry and aligns it
  with all other domain enums.

- **`LayerStatus` StrEnum added** (`types.py`) -- replaces bare `str` on
  `LayerDiffResult.status` and `LayerPair.status`. Values: `Matched`, `Added`,
  `Removed`. All construction sites in `layer_matcher.py`, `cli.py`,
  `json_report.py`, and tests updated. `StrEnum` ensures JSON serialisation
  produces the same string values as before.

- **`LayerDiffResult.layer_type` typed as `LayerType`** -- was `str` with a
  comment; is now the proper enum. `layer_type=pair.layer_type.value` call sites
  simplified to `layer_type=pair.layer_type`.

### Fixed

- **`InCu` classification false-positives** (`layer_matcher.py`) -- the previous
  check `"in" in s and "cu" in s` matched any filename containing both
  substrings (e.g. `incident_copper`, `incoming.Cu`). Replaced with
  `re.search(r"\bin\d+[._]cu\b", s)` which requires a digit immediately after
  `in` and a word boundary on both sides. Four new tests verify correct
  classification and absence of false positives.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Cairo layer transform order** (`renderer.py`) -- reversed the three
  conditional blocks in `_render_layer` from scale->rotation->mirror to
  mirror->rotation->scale in code order. Cairo post-multiplies each call into the
  CTM, so the last call in code is the first transform applied to coordinates;
  the previous order applied transforms to coordinates as mirror->rotation->scale
  instead of the RS-274X sec.4.9-specified scale->rotation->mirror. A new test
  (`test_layer_transform_order_rotation_plus_mirror`) uses a rotation+mirror
  combination to verify the centroid of rendered pixels lands in the correct
  screen quadrant.

- **Block aperture recursion depth guard** (`renderer.py`) -- `_draw_block_flash`,
  `_render_layer`, and `_render_groups` now accept a `depth: int = 0` parameter.
  `_draw_block_flash` returns immediately when `depth >= 10`, matching the
  parser's nesting limit and preventing unbounded recursion on malformed input.
  A new test (`test_block_flash_depth_guard_no_recursion_error`) verifies that a
  15-level nested `BlockAperture` chain completes without `RecursionError`.

- **Stroke fallback line width** (`draw_ops.py`) -- `draw_net_as_stroke` now
  has explicit `case ObroundAperture()` and `case PolygonAperture()` branches
  before `case _:`. Both use `LINE_CAP_ROUND`; obround uses `min(width, height)`
  and polygon uses `outer_diameter`. The previous fallback rendered these valid
  D01 aperture types as a 25 um hairline, producing near-invisible strokes.
  Two new tests verify the corrected apertures produce > 200 lit pixels.

- **CLI `assert` -> explicit error handling** (`cli.py`) -- replaced three
  `assert` statements in `diff_cmd` that guarded against missing paths on
  added/removed/matched layers with `click.echo(..., err=True)` + `sys.exit(2)`
  checks. `assert` is stripped by `python -O`; the new checks work under all
  optimisation levels.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Excellon integer-format coordinates** -- the parser now correctly handles
  integer fixed-decimal coordinate encoding produced by Altium, older KiCad,
  Ultiboard, and most CAM systems. A `_FormatSpec` dataclass captures the
  zero-suppression convention (`LZ` / `TZ`) and digit counts read from the
  `METRIC` / `INCH` header line; `_apply_format()` pads and inserts the decimal
  point accordingly. Explicit digit counts in the header (e.g. `METRIC,LZ,0000.0000`)
  override the defaults. Coordinates that contain a decimal point are passed
  through unchanged, preserving full compatibility with KiCad modern output.
  Files with no format header emit a `DiagnosticSeverity.Warning` and default
  to `METRIC,TZ` 3.3.
- 13 new tests in `tests/test_excellon_parser.py` covering `_apply_format` unit
  tests (decimal pass-through, METRIC LZ 3.3, INCH TZ 2.4, negative coords, zero)
  and end-to-end round-trips (inline content and two new fixtures:
  `tests/fixtures/drill-metric-lz.drl`, `tests/fixtures/drill-inch-tz.drl`).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **License changed from AGPL-3.0 to Apache-2.0** so the tool can be
  used commercially without copyleft obligations. (Landed immediately
  before this version's other changes; recorded here for completeness.)

- **Domain model rename** -- `Net` renamed to `DrawOp` and `NetState` renamed to `CoordState`
  throughout the codebase. The term "net" belongs to EDA net-list semantics; the IR types
  represent drawing primitives and coordinate-system snapshots, not electrical nets.
  - `ParsedImage.nets` -> `draw_ops`
  - `ParsedImage.net_states` -> `coord_states`
  - `BlockAperture.nets` -> `draw_ops`
    All public and internal references updated; import order re-sorted (ruff I001).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Block aperture parsing** -- `%ABD<n>*%` / `%AB*%` extended commands now fully handled in
  `gerber_state.py`. The parser maintains a nested block stack (max depth 10) that redirects
  net emission, layer state, and the bounding box into a `BlockAperture` while the block is
  open; on close the completed aperture is registered into the parent aperture dict. Apertures
  defined before the block open are accessible inside it via a shallow copy of the parent dict.
- `layers: list[LayerState]` field added to `BlockAperture` to capture the block's own
  polarity/layer stack -- matching the reference JS implementation.
- **`BlockFlash` rendering** -- `_draw_block_flash()` helper in `renderer.py` synthesises a
  temporary `ParsedImage` from the block's captured nets/apertures/layers and recursively runs
  the compile -> render pipeline, translating to the flash position via `ctx.translate(x, y)`.
- **Edge-case hardening**:
  - Empty gerber (no geometry) no longer raises; produces a default centred viewport.
  - Boards with coordinates entirely in negative space render and center correctly.
  - Step-and-repeat correctness verified -- 2x2 SR produces measurably more lit pixels than a
    single instance.
- 17 tests in `tests/test_block_aperture.py` covering: parse registration, net capture, parent
  isolation, layer capture, parent-aperture inheritance, invalid D-code warnings, stray close
  warning, `BlockFlash` compile path, render output, empty block, empty gerber viewport, negative
  coordinate centering, and step-and-repeat pixel count.
- `README.md` -- full CLI reference for all three subcommands (`parse`, `render`, `diff`) with
  option tables, overlay colour-scheme description, JSON report schema, and development commands.

### Fixed

- `test_negative_coordinate_viewport` assertion corrected -- `pan_y` is legitimately negative
  for boards in the negative-Y half-plane; test now validates the correct invariant (board
  centre maps to canvas centre) rather than the sign of `pan_y`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`diff` CLI subcommand** (`gerberdiff diff BEFORE_DIR AFTER_DIR`) with options:
  - `--layer NAME` (repeatable) -- restrict diff to named layers
  - `--width` / `--height` -- canvas dimensions (default 2048)
  - `--min-pixels` -- minimum pixel count for a reported region (default 4)
  - `--merge-tolerance` -- region merge padding in inches (default 0.05)
  - `--out-json PATH` -- write JSON diff report
  - `--out-png DIR` -- write per-layer overlay PNGs
  - `--overwrite` -- allow replacing existing output files
  - `--png-show-common` -- shade unchanged geometry grey in PNG overlays
  - `--align-offset X,Y` -- translate board B by (X, Y) inches before diffing
  - `--fail-on-diff` -- exit 1 if any changes detected
  - `--quiet` / `--verbose`
  - Exit codes: 0 = no diff (or diff without `--fail-on-diff`), 1 = diff found with
    `--fail-on-diff`, 2 = parse/IO error.
- **`gerberdiff/export/json_report.py`** -- `build_report(diff_result) -> dict` and
  `write_report(diff_result, path, overwrite)` producing a versioned JSON schema (version: 1)
  with summary (`changed_layers`, `total_regions`, `has_changes`) and per-layer region detail.
  Raises `FileExistsError` when the target exists and `overwrite=False`. Parent directories
  created automatically.
- **`gerberdiff/export/png_export.py`** -- `build_overlay_png(arr_a, arr_b, xor, path, ...)`.
  Colour scheme (BGRA ARGB32): removed -> red `[0,0,255,255]`, added -> green `[0,255,0,255]`,
  changed (both non-zero, different value) -> yellow `[0,255,255,255]`, common (opt-in) -> grey
  `[128,128,128,255]`. Written via `cairocffi.ImageSurface.create_for_data`.
- `DiffResult` and `LayerDiffResult` types added to `gerberdiff/types.py` (`has_changes` is a
  stored field, not a property, so added/removed layers correctly drive `has_changes=True`
  regardless of pixel count).
- 14 tests in `tests/test_json_report.py` and 8 tests in `tests/test_png_export.py`.
- 11 fixture-based integration tests in `tests/test_cli_diff.py` (guarded with
  `pytest.mark.skipif` when fixtures are absent).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`gerberdiff/diff/layer_matcher.py`** -- `match_layers(before_dir, after_dir) -> list[LayerPair]`
  pairs layers by file stem across two directories. Unmatched files are reported as
  `status="added"` or `status="removed"`. Results are sorted by a canonical
  `_LAYER_TYPE_ORDER` (FCu -> BCu -> inner Cu -> masks -> paste -> silk -> edge cuts -> drill ->
  unknown).
- `LayerType` StrEnum with 14 values: `FCu`, `BCu`, `InCu`, `FMask`, `BMask`, `FPaste`,
  `BPaste`, `FSilk`, `BSilk`, `EdgeCuts`, `NPTH`, `PTH`, `Drill`, `Unknown`.
- `LayerPair` dataclass: `name`, `before_path`, `after_path`, `layer_type`, `status`.
- `classify_layer(path) -> LayerType` -- classifies a single file by name/suffix heuristics.
- 29 tests in `tests/test_layer_matcher.py`.
- `scipy-stubs>=1.17.1.4` added to the `[dependency-groups].dev` group.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`gerberdiff/diff/diff_engine.py`** -- pixel-based diff pipeline:
  1. Renders both images to a shared viewport (`merge_bounding_boxes` + `compute_viewport`).
  2. XORs RGB channels to produce a boolean change mask.
  3. `_ccl_and_extract()` -- `scipy.ndimage.label` (4-connectivity) -> `find_objects` ->
     `center_of_mass` -> `list[Region]` with world-space (inch) centroid and bounding box.
  4. `merge_overlapping_regions()` -- iterative weighted-centroid merge within a tolerance.
- `SingleLayerDiff` dataclass: `arr_a`, `arr_b`, `xor`, `regions`, `viewport`,
  `changed_pixel_count`, `total_pixel_count`.
- `compute_diff(image_a, image_b, width, height, alignment_offset, min_pixel_count,
merge_tolerance) -> SingleLayerDiff`.
- `Region`, `LayerDiffResult`, `DiffResult` types added to `gerberdiff/types.py`.
- `coordinate_offset: tuple[float, float] | None` parameter added to `render_to_surface()`
  and `render_to_numpy()` -- applied as `ctx.translate()` after viewport scale, enabling
  panel-offset alignment.
- 17 tests in `tests/test_diff_engine.py`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`render` CLI subcommand** (`gerberdiff render FILE --out-png PATH`) with options:
  `--width`, `--height`, `--overwrite`, `--quiet`, `--verbose`. Accepts both Gerber and
  Excellon files (auto-detected by suffix). Prints render timing under `--verbose`.
- Memory warning for canvases exceeding 16 777 216 pixels (~64 MB) -- non-blocking advisory
  message to stderr.
- 9 tests in `tests/test_cli_render.py`.

### Changed

- **`scipy` promoted to core required dependency** (`scipy>=1.10` in `[project].dependencies`).
  Previously treated as an optional extra; made core because `diff_engine.py` requires
  `scipy.ndimage` and there is no meaningful fallback.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`gerberdiff/render/compiled_render.py`** -- single-pass compile stage that walks the flat
  nets list and groups operations into typed batch objects:
  - `FlashBatch` -- simple flashes sharing one aperture (no hole, no macro/block)
  - `StrokeBatch` -- D01 strokes sharing one aperture
  - `RegionGroup` -- G36/G37 region fill
  - `HoledFlash` -- flash for an aperture with a punch-through hole
  - `MacroFlash` -- flash for a macro aperture (one per net)
  - `BlockFlash` -- flash for a block aperture (one per net; rendered in 0.14.0)
  - `CompiledLayer`, `CompiledRender` containers.
- **`gerberdiff/render/renderer.py`** -- two-pass Cairo rasteriser:
  - `render_to_surface(parsed_image, viewport, draw_color, coordinate_offset)
-> cairo.ImageSurface`
  - `render_to_numpy(parsed_image, viewport, draw_color, coordinate_offset)
-> np.ndarray` (shape `(H, W, 4)` uint8, BGRA; `.copy()` called to detach from Cairo
    buffer before returning)
  - Polarity compositing via `OPERATOR_OVER` (dark) / `OPERATOR_DEST_OUT` (clear).
  - Per-layer transforms: scale, rotation, mirror.
  - Step-and-repeat rendered by nested `ctx.translate` loops.
- 14 tests in `tests/test_renderer.py`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

  - `1` -- Circle
  - `20` -- Vector line
  - `21` -- Center line
  - `4` -- Outline
  - `5` -- Polygon
  - `6` -- Moire
  - `7` -- Thermal
- `draw_macro_flash(ctx, x, y, aperture: MacroAperture)` -- evaluates macro expressions,
  renders each primitive with correct rotation and polarity into the current Cairo context.
- `compute_macro_bounding_radius(aperture: MacroAperture) -> float` -- conservative radius
  estimate used for bounding-box expansion.
- 14 tests in `tests/test_macro_renderer.py`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`gerberdiff/render/viewport.py`**:
  - `Viewport` dataclass (`width`, `height`, `pan_x`, `pan_y`, `zoom`).
  - `compute_viewport(bbox, width, height) -> Viewport` -- fits the bounding box with a 10%
    margin, Y-flipped so Gerber's mathematical Y-up maps to screen Y-down.
  - `merge_bounding_boxes(a, b) -> BoundingBox` -- axis-aligned union of two boxes.
  - `screen_to_world(px, py, vp) -> tuple[float, float]` -- inverse viewport transform.
- **`gerberdiff/render/draw_ops.py`**:
  - `draw_arc_path(ctx, arc_segment, start_x, start_y)` -- draws a Cairo arc path from a
    resolved `ArcSegment`.
  - `draw_net_segment_in_region(ctx, net)` -- adds a net's segment to an open region path.
  - `draw_net_as_stroke(ctx, net, aperture)` -- strokes a D01 net with aperture-derived line
    width and cap style.
  - `draw_flash(ctx, net, aperture)` -- fills/strokes a D03 flash for all standard aperture
    shapes (circle, rectangle, obround, polygon).
- 9 tests in `tests/test_viewport.py` and 13 tests in `tests/test_draw_ops.py`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`gerberdiff/parse/excellon_parser.py`** -- Excellon NC drill format parser. Supports tool
  definitions (`T<n>C<dia>`), drill hits (D03 / no D-code with coordinates), routed slots
  (G00 move + G01 linear route), metric/imperial unit modes, and leading/trailing zero
  suppression. Emits `ParsedImage` with the same IR as the Gerber parser.
- **`parse` CLI subcommand** (`gerberdiff parse FILE`) with options: `--dump-ir` (JSON
  summary to stdout), `--quiet`, `--verbose`. Auto-detects Gerber vs. Excellon by file suffix.
  Exit code 2 on parse errors.
- 8 tests in `tests/test_excellon_parser.py` and 6 tests in `tests/test_cli_parse.py`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-25

  - Format statement (`%FS...%`) and unit mode (`%MO...%`)
  - All aperture definitions via `parse_aperture_definition` (phases 3-4)
  - Macro definitions (`%AM...%`) collected and parsed via `parse_macro_body`
